# GorillaBook

Please run the code with the latest Xcode version ( 11.1 )
Please run the code with devices with iOS version higher than 13.1

Considerations : 

* In the second view I used a label with the title "What's on your mind" and a Text View separately.
* When typing in the textView, the "Add photo" button will appear as an inputAccessoryView.
* After selecting an image it will be displayed in the view.


What is missing :

* I didn't understand the functionality of the blue box with the expand icon, so I displayed the whole table info.
* The logo image in the navigation bar of the first view
* Back button in the second view is still in blue.
* The "Share" button was not implemented.
